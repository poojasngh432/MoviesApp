Now, Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back, but only if he can accomplish the impossibleâ€”inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.",
